## What have I done
* Started with rails 5
* Used as many Rails as possible - including views
* Wrote some basic tests - definitely less than needed because I am out of time

## Some things to improve
* Add auth - devise? - if needed?
* Use different DB
* Use better search solution - like Elasticsearch
* Improve frontend - I am just a BE dev
* I would use Rails only for the backend in real project - and write FE in smth like React/Rails
* Definitely write more test
* Speaking about specs, I think I would use rspec for prod + factory girl
