## How to
* puma to start server

## What have I done
* Started with rails 5
* Used as many Rails as possible - including views
* Wrote some basic tests - definitely less than needed because I am out of time
* I use local: true in forms in preserve old Rails - I would not do it in real life
* Instead of controller tests I decided to concentrate on integration - quick win

## Some things to improve
* Add auth - devise? - if needed?
* Use different DB
* Use better search solution - like Elasticsearch
* Improve frontend - I am just a BE dev
* Add FE validations - now it is only BE
* I would use Rails only for the backend in real project - and write FE in smth like React/Rails
* Definitely write more test
* Speaking about specs, I think I would use factory girl in real life but it does not go by default
* Definitely add CI/CD - it was not mentioned in the task and I do not have time for it
